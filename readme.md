## Introduction and Features
The ToDo Application allows the user to keep track of their tasks. Users can set deadlines, and add tags to their tasks. Furthermore, they can search based on keywords, sort by deadlines and tags, and view their completed and uncompleted tasks.

The card-styled layout allows users to easily view multiple of their tasks at once, and users can easily mark their tasks complete by mousing over the card. The grid system is also animated, allowing a smooth user experience.

Furthermore, should there be a task approaching a deadline, the application is capable of sending out emails to remind the user!

## Challenges and Reflection
This was my first web development project, and I had no prior experiences with any of the languages or concepts, and I took approximately 2 months to self-learn and finish this app. This app was also used as an homework assignment to apply for [my summer internship with CVWO](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~vwo/projects/2021-aac-aunqa.html). Through the struggles, I also picked up on other valuable knowledge, such as Git, cookies and cron jobs. I had fun, built an application that I'm proud of, and glad that I pulled through the initial struggles to complete the app.
